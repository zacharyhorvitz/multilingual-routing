# multilingual-routing

Project exploring translation between a pair of languages, **A->C** via a third (Or more) pivot language(s), **B_0,B_1...**.

Research Qs: 
- What sort of perfomance boosts can we get from routing? (Can we outweigh the cost of compounded error?)
- Can we predict how a given input sentence should be routed?


# TODO:
- Condition routing prediction on output translations
